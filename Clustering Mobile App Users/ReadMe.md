# Mobile App Users Clustering

This project applies machine learning techniques to analyze and segment mobile app users based on their activity data. By leveraging K-means clustering and real-time visualizations, the system uncovers user behavior patterns and supports engagement strategies.

## Features

- Clusters mobile app users using K-means algorithm, based on activity and usage metrics.
- Provides an interactive web interface built with Streamlit for real-time cluster prediction and user data input.
- Visualizes user segments and activity patterns with clear, actionable charts.
- Helps product managers and analysts identify key user groups and enhance engagement strategies.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit
- Scikit-learn (K-means clustering)
- Pandas, NumPy (data processing)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly (visualizations)
