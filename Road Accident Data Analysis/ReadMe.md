# Road Accident Dashboard (Excel Project)

## Introduction

Road accidents are a significant concern globally, resulting in major human and economic losses. Understanding the patterns and causes behind these accidents is critical for creating effective prevention strategies. This project presents an interactive dashboard built in Microsoft Excel that analyzes road accident data from 2021 and 2022.

## Project Overview

This portfolio project uses Excel exclusively for all analysis and visualization. The dashboard provides insights into accident casualties, accident severity, vehicle type involvement, monthly trends, and the influence of environmental conditions such as daylight and darkness.

## Objectives

- **Primary KPI:** Analyze total casualties due to road accidents.
- Examine casualties by **accident severity**.
- Highlight casualties by **vehicle type**.
- Compare **monthly casualties** between 2021 and 2022 to uncover trends.
- Investigate the impact of **daylight vs. dark conditions** on accidents.
- Suggest evidence-driven **interventions** to reduce casualties.

## Data Source

- Year: 2021 and 2022.
- Main fields: Date, Time, Severity, Vehicle Type, Number of Casualties, Lighting Condition (daylight/darkness).

## Methodology

- Data cleaning and standardization in Excel.
- Use of Pivot Tables, Excel charts, and slicers for interactivity.
- Calculation and visualization of KPIs.
- Comparative monthly analysis for identifying seasonal and annual trends.
- Segmentation based on accident conditions (severity, vehicle, environment).

## Insights & Key Findings

- **Total Casualties Analysis:** Presents the overall magnitude of the issue, with year-over-year and monthly trends to quickly spot rises or declines.
- **Casualties by Severity:** Highlights how accident severity impacts outcomes.
- **Casualties by Vehicle Type:** Identifies risk profiles for different vehicles.
- **Month-wise Comparison (2021 vs 2022):** Detects periods of increased risks and improvements, helping prioritize interventions.
- **Daylight vs. Dark Analysis:** Shows, for example, daylight conditions accounted for a total of 305,000 casualties, which underscores the importance of targeted safety measures even during daytime.

## Suggested Interventions

- **Increase Public Awareness:** Campaigns focusing on safe driving practices.
- **Seasonal/Situational Outreach:** Enhanced safety messaging in months or conditions with higher casualties.
- **Vehicle-specific Initiatives:** Safety measures and regulations for high-risk vehicle categories.
- **Environmental Improvements:** Better road lighting and signage for accident-prone areas.

## How to Use This Dashboard

1. **Download the Excel file** from this repository.
2. Open the file in Microsoft Excel (2016 or newer recommended).
3. Use the provided slicers/filters to view trends by year, severity, vehicle, and lighting.
4. Review each chart/KPI to gain actionable insights.

## Future Work

- Expand dashboard with more years of data.
- Add geospatial mapping for location-based insight.
- Integrate advanced analytics for predictive insights.
- Analyze additional factors (weather, road type).
